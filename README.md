# ABSTRACT

COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. This paper presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and python. 
The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not. As a surveillance task performer, it can also detect a face along with a mask in motion. The method attains accuracy up to 95.77% and 94.58% respectively on two different datasets. We explore optimized values of parameters using the Sequential Convolutional Neural Network model to detect the presence of masks correctly without causing over-fitting.


# EXISTING SYSTEM

Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither their users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it. The users send text messages only by typing or forwarding.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM

In proposed system, 
At phase 1: Initially datasets have been loaded to recognize the faces. The datasets are then trained and tested for classification.
At phase 2: Face mask classifier is loaded from the disk. At first voice instruction will be given for proper guidance to wear a mask. Data analysis will take place in next step. Datasets will be analyzed for detection. From that dataset, faces with mask and without mask are identified. Face Mask Detection system is done in Live Stream to know the immediate result. Accuracy of the facemask will be detected. The final output is displayed as “Mask” or “No Mask” with Accuracy.
